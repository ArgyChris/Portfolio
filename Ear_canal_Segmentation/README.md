# Ear canal segmentation

The purpose of this project was to segment anatomical structures coming from CT scans.

### Contents

The used dataset contained a reference image along with 7 binary masks, one for each anatomical or artifical structure of interest. 

### Images

Input images (image.nii) are NIfTI images created from CT scans of the temporal bone of various cadaver heads during pre-clinical trials.

### Masks

Masks are binary images of the various anatomical structures we need to segment, cropped around the region of interest and aligned with the input image.
